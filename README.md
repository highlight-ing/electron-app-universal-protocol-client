# About

Unified and simplified API for Electron application's protocol handlers ("deep links").

Features:
- support for all platforms (Windows, macOS and Linux)
- development mode
- capturing start-up request (if application was not running and protocol request caused it to be started)

## electron-deeplink

This package is based on [electron-deeplink](https://github.com/glawson/electron-deeplink).

Differences:
- switch to `yarn`
- support for prebuilds (via `prebuildify` and GitHub Actions)
- types support for `on('request')`
- no need to call the API as early as possible to catch the first request (just require it)
- no need to create a new instance of class to use the API
- removed a lot of default behavior (like focusing the window after protocol request)
- removed logging support
- minor fixes

Further changes are listed in [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md).

Huge thanks for @glawson for creating `electron-deeplink` and allowing me to continue his work as recommended fork.

# Installation

```sh
# If you use npm:
npm install electron-app-universal-protocol-client

# If you use yarn:
$ yarn add electron-app-universal-protocol-client
```

# Usage

## API

### `electronAppUniversalProtocolClient.on('request', requestHandler)`

Register handler for protocol requests in your application.

```js
electronAppUniversalProtocolClient.on(
  'request',
  async (requestUrl) => {
    // Handle the request
  },
);
```

### `electronAppUniversalProtocolClient.initialize({ protocol: string; mode?: 'development' | 'production' })`

Initialize the client.

`mode` is `'production'` by default.

**Remember to register protocol handlers before calling `initialize`, otherwise you might lose some requests.**

```js
await electronAppUniversalProtocolClient.initialize({
  protocol: 'your-app-id',
  mode: 'development', // Make sure to use 'production' when script is executed in bundled app
});
```

## [Example](./example/main.js)

Please note that example directory contains fake `node_modules` that allows the example to be started within this repository.

# Development mode

Make sure you're launching Electron with your **main script path** as first argument. Development mode is implemented upon this assumption.

# macOS Development Mode Permissions Issue

Due to macOS permissions system, you could experience following errors after starting your Electron app in development mode:
```
[42590:1203/200159.650790:ERROR:mach_port_rendezvous.cc(310)] bootstrap_look_up com.github.my-app-id.MachPortRendezvousServer.42588: Permission denied (1100)
[42590:1203/200159.651421:ERROR:child_thread_impl.cc(228)] Mach rendezvous failed, terminating process (parent died?)
```

To fix them, run this command in project's root directory:
```
sudo xattr -r -d com.apple.quarantine ./
```
